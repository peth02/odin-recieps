        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p>It’s basically a dry meat curry, and though I’ll be making this recipe with pork, 
            you can really use any type of meat you’d like – from beef to chicken – and you 
            could even use other meats if you’d like.</p>
        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li>500 grams minced pork, beef, or chicken</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons southern Thai curry paste</li>
            <li>50 grams lemongrass</li>
            <li>1 red spur chili (this is not completely necessary)</li>
            <li>10 - 15 kaffir lime leaves(use ¼ to sprinkle on top at the end)</li>
            <li>pinch of sugar</li>
            <li>Thai bird chilies(just for the final spicy touch and for extra red color)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>The first step is to take your lemongrass, slice off the bottoms of the stalks, tear off two or three of the tough outer layers, and then finely shave it. The finer you shave the lemongrass, the more flavor it will add, and the the easier it will be to chew.</li>
            <li><p>To prepare the kaffir lime leaves, you want to grab about five or six leaves, which come as a pair, then I like to fold them over, so you’ve got a nice layered sandwich of kaffir lime leaves. Slice off any of the big stems if there are any, and then finely slice them into thin strips.</p></li>
            <li>I included the spur chili in this recipe mostly to give the khua kling (คั่วกลิ้ง) a beautiful red accent color, but it's not what gives the dish its spice - that comes from the curry paste. For the spur chili, just cut off the stem, slice the chili in half, and then slice it into thin diagonal strips. Set all those ingredients aside, and we'll come back to them later.</li>
            <li><p>Turn on your stove to a medium high heat, heat up your wok or pan for a few seconds, and then add about 3 tbsp. of southern Thai curry paste (it may be kind of dry, but since this is a dry curry, you don't want to add any oil).</p></li>
            <li>One of the tricks my wife taught me, so the curry paste doesn't burn, is to quickly add in just 1 spoon of meat into the curry paste and start to stir fry it. This will give the curry paste a little extra moisture, but it will still get that direct heat that you want, so the curry paste reaches its maximum flavor potential.</li>
            <li><p>Fry the curry paste for 2 - 3 minutes, and then add in the rest of the meat. Your pan should be quite hot, and due to the dryness, it might start to stick to the bottom. So you want to really work the wok hard by scraping and getting all that good flavor off the bottom of the pan.</p></li>
            <li>Stir fry the meat until it’s broken into small minced pieces, and almost all the way cooked through, then toss in just a pinch of sugar, depending on how much you like (I used about ½ teaspoon, but I know some Thai cooks would use a whole spoon in their recipe).</li>
            <li><p>Give it a quick stir, then add the lemongrass.</p></li>
            <li>Quickly stir it, then toss in about ¾ of your shaved kaffir lime leaves. Stir fry for about 1 minute.</li>
            <li><p>Just a few seconds before turning off your heat, add the sliced red spur chili, stir fry for a few more seconds, and turn off your heat, but keep frying for another minute or so.</p></li>
            <li>Grab a bowl, and dish out your khua kling (คั่วกลิ้ง).</li>
            <li><p>The final step is to take the remaining portion of your finely shaved kaffir lime leaves (of you can slice more if you used them all), along with a handful of sliced Thai bird chilies, and sprinkle them on top of your plate of khua kling (คั่วกลิ้ง).</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
        <p>As long as you have a batch of southern Thai curry paste ready to go, this recipe for khua kling (คั่วกลิ้ง) shouldn't take long. You can serve khua kling (คั่วกลิ้ง) with a fresh plate of rice, and a combination of other southern Thai dishes as well. Enjoy!</p>
