        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p>If you love the flavor of the curry, but the stir fry cooking method, you’ll love this Thai recipe.
            The best thing about this dish is that it’s available at nearly every single Thai stir fry street 
            food restaurant, and while it’s excellent on the streets, it’s even better when you make it at home
             using freshly made red curry paste.</p>
        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 chicken breasts(300 grams)</li>
            <li>⅓ cup of chopped string beans</li>
            <li>3 - 5 kaffir lime leaves</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Thai red curry paste, or alternatively packaged red curry paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fish sauce</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>The first thing you need to do is take your chicken and slice it into small bite sized pieces. I like to cut it quite fine so there’s more surface area for flavor, and so it cooks quicker.</li>
            <li><p>Cut the Chinese long beans (or green beans) into 1 inch pieces.</p></li>
            <li>Once your chicken and long beans are cut, go ahead and light your stove on low heat and add in 1 tablespoon of oil. You really need to use about 1 tablespoon of oil, if you use less, the curry paste will burn and stick to the pan.</li>
            <li><p>No need to wait until your oil is hot, just toss in about 3 tablespoons of red curry paste into the oil and start stir frying it in the oil. Let it sizzle for about 20 - 30 seconds on low heat, and it should really be fragrant (you might even cough from the frying chilies!).</p></li>
            <li>Next add your chicken, turn up the heat to high, and start stir frying constantly, fully mixing the chicken with the curry sauce.</li>
            <li><p>Quickly season with 1 teaspoon of fish sauce (give your curry paste a test to see how salty it already is, from the package it might be saltier than the homemade version), and ½ teaspoon sugar.</p></li>
            <li>Stir fry constantly, and at this point if it’s getting dry, add a couple tablespoons of water.</li>
            <li><p>Keep stir frying the chicken on high heat for about 2 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked.</p></li>
            <li>When the chicken is fully cooked, add the sliced long beans, and then break in about 3 - 5 kaffir limes leaves.</li>
            <li><p>Stir fry for just 30 seconds and then turn off the heat. You want the long beans to still be nice and crisp.</p></li>
            <li>Dish your gai pad prik gaeng (ไก่ผัดพริกแกง) out onto a plate and serve with freshly steamed rice.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
        <p> To make your dish extra authentic, you can make a small bowl of prik nam pla, or fish sauce and chilies. Just dice up a few Thai chilies, and a clove of garlic, and add a couple tablespoons of fish sauce, and if you like, a squeeze of lime juice.</p>
